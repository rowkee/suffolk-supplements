              Hello! I'm Rick, founder of Suffolk Supplements. I wanted to tell
              you a little bit about how I came to be here and why our products
              could be great for you. Unless you're at the absolute cutting
              edge, a lot of tech work is just pushing pixels for products
              nobody really needs.
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              I'm a Suffolk boy, and I did what most Suffolk boy do which is
              move to London after university. I then went on to work in tech
              the next decade. Now, after 10 long years I realise that unless
              you're at the absolute cutting edge, a lot of tech work is just
              pushing pixels for products nobody really needs.
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              When I left London and to come back to Suffolk, I finally had
              space to think clearly. I realised that I wanted to do something
              that actually felt meaningful and incorporated the things I
              learned to value in my career so far.
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              I wanted to:
              <ul>
                <li>Build something that actually feels meaningful.</li>
                <li>Make products that meaningfully improve people's lives.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              How I Found Mushrooms
            </h2>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              I'd like to preface this with the fact that I'm not an alternative
              medicine or wellness nut. Most of it feels like marketing dressed
              up as science.
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              But I've always been fascinated by natural products that have real
              research behind them. I love experimenting—trying things out,
              seeing if they actually deliver on their claims.
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              That's how I stumbled onto functional mushrooms. I started
              researching Lion's Mane, dug into the actual studies, and thought
              "let's see if this is real." Tried it myself. It worked.
            </p>

            <h2
              style={{
                fontSize: "1.6rem",
                marginTop: "2.5rem",
                marginBottom: "1.5rem",
                color: "#4a90a4",
              }}

              Why Suffolk?
            </h2>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              Once I knew this stuff was legitimate, I had a simple question:
              Lion's Mane grows in Suffolk. So why isn't anyone doing this
              properly here?
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              The market's flooded with low-quality extracts, mostly starch
              filler from questionable sources. I saw an opportunity to make
              something clean, local, and genuinely effective.
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              Everything aligned: real product, real benefits, real science.
              Suffolk-grown.
            </p>

            <h2
              style={{
                fontSize: "1.6rem",
                marginTop: "2.5rem",
                marginBottom: "1.5rem",
                color: "#4a90a4",
              }}

              What I'm Building
            </h2>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              Products that actually improve people's lives. Natural doesn't
              mean unscientific—it means both. Quality over marketing. If you
              make something good, people come back.
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              I'm growing these mushrooms myself, small batch, with complete
              transparency. No compromises on ingredients or process.
            </p>

            <h2
              style={{
                fontSize: "1.6rem",
                marginTop: "2.5rem",
                marginBottom: "1.5rem",
                color: "#4a90a4",

              The Honest Truth
            </h2>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              I know this sounds like snake oil. The wellness industry has
              earned that reputation.
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem", fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              But the research is solid. I'm growing these in Suffolk, testing
              everything, and being completely transparent about the process.
            </p>

            <p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem" }}>
              Try it. See if it works for you. That's all I ask.
